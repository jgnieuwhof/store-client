      We ship almost everywhere! International customers are able to order from our website,
      but are liable for all import customs & duties. No, we will not adjust the declaration
      amount on your parcel. Donâ€™t even ask! Please email us if placing an international order
      so that we can quote your shipping price. An invoice may be sent to you to cover extra
      shipping costs and will require payment before the order is mailed.
      Any overages will be payed back to you.
      All orders are insured for total value including shipping.
      We ship via Canada Post Tracked Packet International unless otherwise specified.
      We are not responsible for shipping delays once the product leaves Canada and
      can not track packages past the Canadian border.
